# Main python/ipynb code directory

## Description

In this core repository we have the programs and tests to analyse the CSV files and their trials.
Contains the modules to automatically extract the data columns for each trial, for any task.
*TODO* : Statistics module. 

## Getting Started

[Notebook Walkthrough](https://github.com/toelt-llc/gaze-kuleuven/blob/main/code/nb_walkthrough.ipynb)  
[Running an animation Example]: see 'Executing programs'

### Dependencies

* Python, with libraries:  
 -Jupyterlab, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

-[Images](https://github.com/toelt-llc/gaze-kuleuven/tree/main/code/images)  
**Scripts & Notebooks** :   
>anim_showcase.py : script used to plot and save the animations from trial(s).  
>convert.sh : bash script to convert all CSVs to UTF8, to normalize the pre-processing.  
>csv_load.py : contains the python class to extract the trials from a CSV.   
>preprocessing.ipynb : first notebook and attempts at reading the CSVs.

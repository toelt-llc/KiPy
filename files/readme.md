# Source file folder
Folder for the original csv files (most files are not upload on git for security and size issues).  
- *./utf8/* stores the converted csv's of normal experiments  
- *./utf8_2/* stores the converted csv's of flickering experiments
- *./pickles* contain the compressed csv's from both experiments. Since the source files were too large for github the pickle package is used to store them.

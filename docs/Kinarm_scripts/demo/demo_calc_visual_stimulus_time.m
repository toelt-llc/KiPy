function demo_calc_visual_stimulus_time()
% The purpose of this function is to provide sample code that calculates the
% time at which a visual stimulus would have been presented to a subject, taking
% into account all of the various delays, including the location of the visual
% stimulus on the subject display screen

tDisplayDelays = 0.010;			% e.g. display delay (including response time and other internal delays)
numBufferedFrames = 1;			% e.g. the number of frames that are buffered by the subject display

% Alternatively, one can estimate tDisplayDelays from the feed_forward value
% that is stored/used in Dexterit-E. The feed-forward delay is optimized for a
% location ~33% from the top of the subject display (i.e. closest to the
% subject). Additionally, there is typically about ~1 frame of delay due to
% DexDisplay.exe for a total of 1.33 frames. 
% As of 2016, all displays shipped with KINARM Labs have a single frame buffer.

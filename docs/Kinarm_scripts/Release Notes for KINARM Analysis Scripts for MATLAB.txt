Release Notes for KINARM Analysis Scripts for MATLAB

----- v3.1.0 (Mar, 2021) ----- 
Version 3.1 of the analysis scripts is required to read exams collected with
Dexterit-E 3.9 and later, i.e. exams stored in the .kinarm format. The older
.zip format data can still be read with this version of the scripts.

The zip_load() method has been re-named exam_load(), to reflect that it will load either file format (.kinarm or .zip). 
The zip_load() method still exists and works identically to exam_load(), however, zip_load() will be deprecated in a future release

This update to the scripts provides significant improvement in loading speed
over previous versions. You can expect that reading .zip files will take about 1/2 
the time they used to. 

NEW FEATURES:
KAS-14 - A new demo script is available for showing how to use the scripts to calculate 
        intra-muscular torques (demo/demo_calc_im_torques.m).
KAS-37 - Channels with the name XXX_TimeStamp are not filtered as part of a call to filter_double_pass()
KAS-39 - The version of analysis used on KST is loaded into data.analysis.analysis_version
KAS-44 - Improve the speed of loading exam (by loading into memory directly instead of unzipping the files to disk)
KAS-70 - A new function is available to calculate shoulder and elbow angle. velocity and acceleration
        KINARM_add_sho_elb.m

BUG FIXES
KAS-41 - Providing a clearer error message if the file you are trying to load does not exist.
KAS-52 - Corrected typo in help for KINARM_add_torques (duplicate reference to [ELB|SHO]TorIM)

----- v3.0.2 (Dec 3, 2019) ----- 
NEW FEATURES:
PDF documentation update

----- v3.0.1 (Nov 30, 2018) ----- 
NEW FEATURES:
KAS-39 - Read in the analysis version information for KST exams that have been analyzed.
KAS-40 - Added a "demo" folder and moved demo scripts there. Added demo_find_peak_speeds.m function to show some rudimentary analysis.

----- v3.0 (July 19, 2018) ----- 
Version 3.0 of the KINARM Analysis Scripts presents a significant update to these scripts. In particular, they can now 
handle data output from the zip_load function natively, and there has been some re-naming and re-organization to 
simplify their structure. They have also been re-named KINARM Analysis Scripts.

PLEASE NOTE: Every effort has been made to ensure the updates in this version of the KINARM Analysis Scripts are backward 
	compatible with pervious releases. As such, any code you have written using previous versions of the supplied functions
	should not require any changes to run with this update. In the limited cases where we have identified issues you 
	need to be made aware of the functions have been updated with complete help for upgrading.

NEW FEATURES:
CT-2 - Various functions have been updated to handle data in the format of zip_load directly (i.e. functionName(data,...), 
	where data = zip_load), as well is the legacy format (i.e. functionName(data(ii).c3d, ...), where data = zip_load).
CT-33 - If a data file was re-named within Dexterit-E (i.e. in the exam tree), that name is now loaded into the data 
	structure as text in the field file_label.
CT-33 - The actual filename is now also stored as a text in a field called file_name (the original field filename, which 
	is a cell array, still exists).
CT-36 - KINARM_add_friction() now will add friction based on default values for each KINARM robot type if no friction 
	values are passed in.
CT-42 - The StatusBits field is now loaded as an integer (uint32), to ensure that they are not filtered by 
	c3d_filter_dblpass().
CT-44 - zip_load() now auto sorts the trials into the order in which they were run.
CT-46 - c3d_add_video_latency() and c3d_filter_dblpass() have been re-named add_video_latency() and filter_double_pass(). 
	c3d_load.m, c3d_single_file_load.m and correctXTorque.m have been embedded within zip_load.m. Direct support of 
	pre Dexterit-E 3.0 data is no longer supported.
Updated some of the inline help for various functions.


BUG FIXES:
CT-34 - Fixed issue in c3d_filter_dblpass() which caused it to crash if any analog channels are integer. Integer fields 
	are no longer filtered (required to be compatible with data produced by Dexterit-E 3.7, which saves some integer channels).
CT-35 - Fixed issue in sort_trials() so that it sorts by execution order by default (without input arguments) and can 
	accept the data structure from zip_load() when there are multiple exam files.
CT-37 - Fixed issue in zip_load() in which analog channel names with invalid characters for MATLAB fields would cause 
	zip_load() to crash.
CT-39 - Fixed issue in zip_load() in which exam files with different fields (e.g. .analysis field) will cause zip_load()
	to crash.
CT-47 - Fixed issue in KINARM_add_torques() in which the torques and forces applied by the robot the subject had the 
	incorrect sign.
CT-48 - Fixed issue in KINARM_create_trough_database() which would result an incorrect estimate of hand trough location 
	when used with KINAR_add_trough_inertias() if "estimate trough location" was used. The results would be a very 
	significant overestimation of hand trough inertia, resulting in incorrect estimates of applied torques and 
	intramuscular torques. The severity of this bug will depend on the speed and acceleration of the forearm.


----- v2.21 (Apr 30, 2018) ----- 
NEW FEATURES:
CT-23 - Updated the code to read analysis results from Arm Position Matching and Visually Guided Reaching.
CT-25 - Increased the speed of loading files for all versions of MATLAB (via changes to  c3d_load_single_file.m). 
CT-25 - File loading progress at command prompt now shown by '.' for each c3d file (instead of c3d file name). 
CT-25 - Fixed a slow-down in R2017b (slow-down was caused by Mathworks' deprecation of genvarname() ).
CT-31 - Updated exam file reading to automatically convert force torque sensor status information to uint32

BUG FIXES:
CT-25 - Trailing whitespace is now removed correctly from strings in data(fileNum).c3d(trialNum).VIDEO_LATENCY.LABELS
CT-27 - Fixed a possible crash in R2018a (due to an 'analysis' folder already existing on the MATLAB path)



----- v2.20 (Jan 10, 2018) ----- 
NEW FEATURES:
Improved help description for KINARM_add_torques.m
Updated KINARM_add_friction.m help with more recent typical friction estimates of Human KINARM Exoskeleton and KINARM End-Point robots

KINARM_add_hand_Kinematics and KINARM_add_torques did not handle EP correctly (looked for certain KINARM parameters that are part of calibration for Exo, but are part of xxxx_KINARM for EP).
One of those m-files also made that assumption that the right and left KINARMs were the same robot type.  That assumption is no longer made.

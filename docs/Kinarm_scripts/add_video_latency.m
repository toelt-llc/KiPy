%ADD_VIDEO_LATENCY Add min/max limits to video latency
%	DATA_OUT = ADD_VIDEO_LATENCY(DATA_IN, DISPLAY_LATENCY,
%	NUM_BUFFERED_FRAMES) adds minimum and maximum times to the VIDEO_LATENCY
%	field of the structure DATA_IN.  These minimum and maximum times represent
%	the limits of when the upper-left pixel in the video frame was shown to the
%	subject. These times are based on:  
%
%		(1) the send and acknowledge times for the video frames (i.e. between
%		the Robot Computer and the Dexterit-E Computer), which provide absolute
%		time constraints on the command sequence. These calculations also
%		include some 'intelligence' which corrects acknowledgement times based
%		on the fact that the minimum time between the actual display of an image
%		is the video frame period.   
%
%		(2) buffering by the subject display, if present (most modern displays
%		buffer the entire image before displaying it, whereas CRT-like displays
%		have no buffer) 
%
%		(3) other latencies in the display (which includes the "response time"
%		reported by the display manufacturer, but can also include other delays
%		if they exist. Please see the Dexterit-E User Guide reference section
%		for more information).   
%
%	The input structure DATA_IN	can in one of two forms, based on zip_load:
%   data = zip_load;
%   dataNew = add_video_latency(data)
%     OR
%   dataNew.c3d = add_video_latency(data(ii).c3d)

%	The DISPLAY_LATENCY input is a required input (in seconds), and should be a
%	measure of all delays inherent in the display, excluding any buffering by
%	the display. The typical sources of delay are: (i) response time (e.g. 5-10
%	ms); (ii)asynchronous backlight pulse-width-modulation (0 if none, or 4 ms
%	if 120 Hz PWM); (iii) internal processing delays (0-5 ms) 
%
%	The NUM_BUFFERED_FRAMES is an optional input which indicates the number of
%	frames that the display buffers. The default value is 1 (i.e. if no argument
%	is input to the function) . For most modern displays, this value = 1. For
%	CRT or CRT-like displays, this value should be set = 0. 
%
%   Note 1: under normal conditions (i.e. in which the communication between the
%   Robot and Dexterit-E computers is not delayed via parallel or conflicting
%   process), the maximum time represents the actual time of the display (i.e.
%   typically the acknowledgement is received within ~1 ms of the Vsync pulse on
%   the video card displaying the image).  
%
%	Note 2: this function does NOT account for discrepancies in timing of visual
%	stimulus on different parts of the screen. Most modern displays behave in a
%	manner similar to CRTs: the frame is displayed sequentially, line-by-line,
%	from top to bottom, over the duration of an entire single frame. An example
%	of an exception to this behaviour are many DLP projectors which display the
%	entire frame synchronously, but which display the RGB colours sequentially.
